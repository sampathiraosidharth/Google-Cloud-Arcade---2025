## Overview

Gmail add-ons automate tasks within Gmail, saving time and effort for users. Gmail add-ons can examine incoming messages and act on them in various ways, such as:

- Displaying additional information for the user in the Gmail UI.
- Connecting to non-Google services to retrieve information or take other actions.
- Providing an interactive interface to allow the user to control the add-on or send information to another service.

In this lab, you will create a Gmail Add-on that allows you to quickly change the labels of an email thread.
